// This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.js, which will include all the files
// listed below.
//
// Any JavaScript/Coffee file within this directory, lib/assets/javascripts, provider/assets/javascripts,
// or provider/assets/javascripts of packages, if any, can be referenced here using a relative path.
//
// It's not advisable to add code directly here, but if you do, it'll appear in whatever order it
// gets included (e.g. say you have require_tree . then the code will appear after all the directories
// but before any files alphabetically greater than 'application.js'

// Read Mincer README (https://github.com/nodeca/mincer#mincer-directives) for details
